 So I work at a Hostel and I'vegot a boss from the Netherlands who leaves notes for people betweenshifts with special jobs to do to keep the place running.The note he left tonight was simply too hilarious to not share.Spelling/Grammar mistakes have been left in for accuracy and the lulz.My Dutch Boss wrote:  Alex, the Groovemachine,  How's today?  Here stuff like a cherry;  The pile of stuff>> can you staple it by month please? So staple a  month together.  Keep washing machines spinning non stop all of them like a Boeiing  Pile of mattress protectors> check dorm beds> if you see one ripped  badly> replace with a fine fresh one  There's a little jap dude or asian roaming around our hostel, he  sneaks in here to use facilities and may plant bombs. He seems to  live out of a car on the street here next to us. Grab his ass if ye  see him and kick it to the curb. Thanks  Can you dig it?  Have a good one then!So what should I do about this mysterious asian saboteur?[/hide]

Okay I'll tell you:  The door on the right of the guest laundry machines? that is the  cripple toilet. It is filled with sheets now mostly. I left the door  open and the light on, you can turn the light off when you are done.  Some are already sorted. Most are not. Here is the idea>  Take big green bags and fill them with twin sheets  Another bag with double sheets (flat and fitted)  Another bag with queen sheets (flat and fitted)  Another with blankets  Another with pillow cases. And so forth  Make sure they are all folded nicely.  Write on outside of each bag in big clear black what is in the bag  just like Toni did.  And keep machines cranking please, I got more big blankets as well.  Thanks so much!![/hide]

Is the Turkey shot full of growth hormones, anti-biotics, and force  fed? Is the dude debeaked, raised on crap food, and confined to a  space no bigger than a football his whole life? Did he ever see  natural light and smell anything other than his stressed out fellow  Turkeys and his own toilet?  Let's hope not.  So this Thursday it is then around 6pm.

 Yes I have been. Binged until 6 am, playedpool, talked about life 'n' shit. Was fun.4/8/11My Dutch Boss wrote:  Hi climber of trees,  BFI does not want to pick up our garden trash. Them little ones. So  can you please take out all the palm leaves and pieces of them since  that is the reason why they won't (wonder why? Me too), chuck the  palms in the dumpster and all will be cherry again I guess. Thanks!  Can you scrub the hell out of all the baking dishes in kitchen? Use  the metal and go hardcore, not hippie style. All stains etc. gots to  be gone.  You can use some of the new spray that is at reception, it is for  ovens but try it out, shiver weep and fear!!  Feel loved.  Have a splendid evening dear fellow.  P.S. - Check if 7 and 11 are cool. Ask Laura.As much as I wish "7 and 11l" were code names of secret agents we hireto assassinate people, it just means "check if rooms 7 and 11 have beencleaned yet."[/hide]
