[hide]So I work at a Hostel and I've got a boss from the Netherlands who leaves notes for people between shifts with special jobs to do to keep the place running.<br />
<br />
The note he left tonight was simply too hilarious to not share.  Spelling/Grammar mistakes have been left in for accuracy and the lulz.<br />

Keep washing machines spinning non stop  all of them like a Boeiing<br />

There's a little jap dude or asian roaming around our hostel, he sneaks in here to use facilities and <strong>may plant bombs</strong>.  He seems to live out of a car on the street here next to us.  Grab his ass if ye see him and kick it to the curb. Thanks<br />

Have a good one then!</blockquote><br />

[hide]Yeah, I was expecting more from "THE bin" but it turned out to just be a knee-high blue recycling bin that I had to chuck . . . in a rage of course.<br />
<br />
The rollerblade thing: We have a single rollerblade with good wheels and a pair of rollerblades with crap wheels.  I took the wheels off the lone rollerblade, chucked it . . . bloodshot eyes, and then all was right with the hostel.  : D<br />

[hide]Oh trust me, it's a sweet job and a sweet boss.  Sure there are some relatively big upkeep tasks but it seems worth it to me.<br />
<br />
The shifts are 4.5 hours each.  <br />
Shift 1 - 8 - 12:30<br />
2 hour lunch break where we close.<br />
Shift 2 - 2:30 - 7<br />
Shift 3 - 7 - 11:30<br />
<br />
So no matter which shift you get you have plenty of free time.  (Not to mention a roof over your head and free food that the guests leave behind : D)[/hide]

Wedged in the front door were two index cards.  They were written in a hurried script.<br />
<br />
One said <br />
<br />
"Hostage Situation:<br />

Will be Bomb"<br />
<br />
The second one said:<br />
<br />
"Royalty Hostage <br />
<br />
Missing Agent<br />
<br />
(bomb included)"<br />

The employee who found them called the cops so I woke up to see a patrol car outside and him being questioned.  They took the notes as evidence and we'll see what happens.  (Could it be the asian guy from several months ago?)[/hide]

<strong>Laundry!  very important.</strong>  Keep running <strong>non stop.</strong>  Use eggtimer in desk to keep on top of it time wise.  haley needs to be done first though, the sheets.  The towels and rags can be done after the hostel stuff is done.<br />

Keep blue curtain always CLSED and door close so guest don't see the mess and start barfing on each other in utter misery.<br />

Don't steal, I know you want to.  I saw it in my crystal ball.  "But what would I steal" you may now wonder?  "Haaaah!  Says I, only the gypsy, the ball, and I know this.  But since we just told you, you won't steal anymore.  So we can answer you with "nothing"<br />
<br />
Yes, life is a rever, everflowing, bleeping and blinking.<br />
<br />
Adios my fine friend.  Know that we adore the air thou breathest on that day after the 4 days you were completely twisted on certain helpers and were floating on a carpet inches above the ground, grinning and twsting.<br />
